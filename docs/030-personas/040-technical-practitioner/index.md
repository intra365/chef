# Technical Practitioners

Technical Practitioners are engineers and technical professionals who are directly involved in building, deploying, and maintaining systems. They work hands-on with code, infrastructure, and tools to deliver and support services.

## Characteristics

### Primary Focus
- **Hands-on Implementation**: Writing code, configuring systems, building pipelines
- **Technical Excellence**: Deep understanding of tools, frameworks, and best practices
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging issues, optimizing performance, implementing solutions
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with evolving technologies and practices

### Key Responsibilities
- Develop and maintain applications and services
- Build and manage deployment pipelines
- Implement security controls and best practices
- Monitor and troubleshoot production systems
- Participate in on-call rotations
- Document technical implementations

### Information Needs
- **How-to guides** and step-by-step instructions
- **Code examples** and configuration samples
- **Command-line references** and API documentation
- **Troubleshooting guides** and debugging techniques
- **Best practices** and design patterns
- **Architecture diagrams** showing technical details

### Communication Style
- Prefers technical detail over high-level summaries
- Values code snippets and practical examples
- Appreciates references to relevant documentation
- Responds well to terminal commands and configuration examples

## Experience Levels

Technical Practitioners operate at different experience levels:

- **Junior**: Learning fundamentals, needs detailed guidance and examples
- **Mid-level**: Competent with core technologies, can work independently on defined tasks
- **Senior**: Expert in domain, can design solutions and mentor others
- **Lead**: Defines technical direction, establishes standards, guides teams

## Specialized Roles

Technical Practitioners encompass several specialized roles:

### [Developer](./developer.md)

### [DevOps Engineer](./devops-engineer.md)
Engineers building and maintaining deployment pipelines and infrastructure automation.

### [Security Engineer](./security-engineer.md)
Engineers implementing security controls and managing vulnerabilities.

### [Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)](./sre.md)
Engineers ensuring service reliability, performance, and scalability.

### [Data Engineer](./data-engineer.md)
Engineers building data pipelines and managing data infrastructure.
