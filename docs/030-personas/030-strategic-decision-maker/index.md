- **Risk Management**: Assessing technical risks and tradeoffs

### Key Responsibilities
- Define technical architecture and standards
- Make build vs. buy decisions
- Evaluate and select technologies
- Design system integrations
- Mentor and guide teams
- Align technology with business goals

### Information Needs
- **Architecture diagrams** showing system design
- **Technology comparisons** and evaluations
- **Best practices** and design patterns
- **Cost analysis** and ROI considerations
- **Risk assessments** and mitigation strategies
- **Integration patterns** and guidelines

### Communication Style
- Prefers high-level overviews with drill-down options
- Values visual diagrams and architecture views
- Appreciates decision frameworks and comparisons
- Responds well to business context and ROI
