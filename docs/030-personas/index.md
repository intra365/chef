# Personas Overview

Welcome to the Intra365 Personas guide. This section helps you understand which documentation is most relevant for your role and experience level.

## What are Personas?

Personas represent different roles and responsibilities in your organization. Each persona has:

- **Specific goals** - What you're trying to accomplish
- **Key concerns** - What matters most in your role
- **Documentation priorities** - Which docs are most relevant
- **Experience levels** - From beginner to expert
- **Tools & technologies** - What you work with daily

## How to Use Personas

1. **Select your persona** from the list above
2. **Review the persona profile** to understand goals and priorities
3. **Follow recommended documentation** tailored to your role
4. **Adjust experience level** to match your expertise
5. **Explore related personas** for cross-functional knowledge

## Persona Inheritance Model

Personas follow an inheritance hierarchy:

```
Base Persona (Common properties)
  ├── Generic Persona (Role family)
  │   └── Specialized Persona (Specific role)
```

This means:
- **Common properties** (like experience levels) are inherited by all personas
- **Generic personas** define broad role families with shared characteristics
- **Specialized personas** add specific focus areas and tools

## Experience Levels

All personas support four experience levels:

- **Beginner** (0-1 years) - Getting started, learning basics
- **Intermediate** (1-3 years) - Comfortable with fundamentals, building skills
- **Advanced** (3-5 years) - Deep expertise, mentoring others
- **Expert** (5+ years) - Industry leader, defining best practices

## Getting Started

Not sure which persona fits you? Start with these questions:

- **What is your primary responsibility?** (Building, Operating, Designing, Auditing)
- **What do you work with daily?** (Code, Infrastructure, Architecture, Compliance)
- **What are your main concerns?** (Speed, Stability, Scalability, Security)
- **What outcomes do you deliver?** (Features, Uptime, Standards, Reports)

Still unsure? Browse all personas to find the best match, or contact us for guidance.
